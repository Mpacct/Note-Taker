# Note Taker 
  
## Description

This application is designed to allow users to write notes and save them to an online notepad.  It allows the user to view previously saved notes, by hitting the note from the column on the left, but also allows them to make new notes that will save to the column on the left.  The delete functionality has not been implemented, bbut that is something that can be implemented aas part of future development.
